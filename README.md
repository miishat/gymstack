## ✨ Features & Navigation

Gym-Stack consists of several minimal, hyper-focused tabs tailored for the gym floor.

### 🏠 Dashboard (Home)
Your command center. The Dashboard greets you with an overview of your recent action:
- **Volume History**: A visual graph tracking your total lifting volume over your last 7 sessions. See the line go up, feel the gains.
- **Muscle Activity**: A beautiful heatmap showing which muscle groups you've destroyed (and which ones you might be neglecting) over the past week.

### 📊 Analytics (Stats)
Dive deep into your progress over time.
- **Exercise Trends**: Interactive line charts track your estimated 1-Rep Max (1RM) and total volume for specific exercises.
- Visualize your continuous improvement and ensure you are applying progressive overload.

### 📝 Logger (Log)
Where the magic happens. The Logger is designed to be lightning-fast between sets.
- Log your session organically: choose the muscle, search for an exercise (or create a **Custom Exercise**), and input your numbers.
- **Bodyweight & Unilateral Mode**: Easily toggle exercises as bodyweight-only or unilateral (calculates double volume automatically).
- **Smart Ghosting**: When you log a new exercise, Gym-Stack automatically remembers the weight and reps you hit *last time*, directly filling in the placeholders so you always know what numbers you need to beat.
- **Workout Templates**: Load previously saved templates to instantly pre-populate your entire routine, or save your current session as a template for next time.
- Tap the **Checkmark** at the top right to complete the workout and save it into your history. 

### 🧮 Tools (Plates & 1RM)
Stop doing gym math in your head.
- **Plate Calculator**: Enter your target weight, select your bar weight, and it will immediately spit out the exact plates you need to load on each side.
- **1RM Calculator**: Quickly estimate your 1-Rep Max using the Epley formula by inputting weight and reps.

### ⏱️ Timer
A built-in rest timer to keep you honest.
- Tap to start your 90-second countdown between sets. Need more rest? Pause and resume anytime.

### 📖 History
Your personal trophy room. 
- Review all your past logged sessions. 
- **PR Tracking**: Automatically identifies and awards a golden "PR" badge to sets that break your previous 1RM record for that exercise.
- Expand a workout to see the exact sets, reps, and weights. 
- Edit past sessions, delete them, or save them as reusable **Templates**.

### ⚙️ Settings (Config)
Customize your ambiance and manage your data.
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch perfectly between modern Dark Mode and an incredibly clean Light Mode with a simple tap.
- **Data Management**: Export your entire workout history and custom exercises as a JSON backup, or import a previous backup to restore your data.
- **Customization**: Manage and delete your custom exercises and dynamically-colored custom muscle groups.

## 🔒 Privacy & Data
