## ✨ Features & Navigation

Gym-Stack consists of several minimal, hyper-focused tabs tailored for the gym floor.

### 🏠 Dashboard (Home)
Your command center. The Dashboard greets you with an overview of your recent action:
- **Volume History**: A visual graph tracking your total lifting volume over your last 7 sessions. See the line go up, feel the gains.
- **Muscle Activity**: A beautiful heatmap showing which muscle groups you've destroyed (and which ones you might be neglecting) over the past week.

### 📝 Logger (Log)
Where the magic happens. The Logger is designed to be lightning-fast between sets.
- Log your session organically, step by step: choose the muscle, search for an exercise, input your numbers.
- **Smart Ghosting**: When you log a new exercise, Gym-Stack automatically remembers the weight and reps you hit *last time*, directly filling in the placeholders so you always know what numbers you need to beat.
- Tap the **Checkmark** at the top right to complete the workout and save it into your history. 

### 🧮 Tools (Plates)
Stop doing gym math in your head. 
- Enter your target weight, select your bar weight (45lb or 35lb), and it will immediately spit out the exact plates you need to load on each side.

### ⏱️ Timer
A built-in rest timer to keep you honest.
- Tap to start your 90-second countdown between sets. Need more rest? Pause and resume anytime.

### 📖 History
Your personal trophy room. 
- Review all your past logged sessions. 
- Tap on a workout to expand it and see the exact sets, reps, and weights. 
- Make a mistake? Tap the **Edit** button to load the session back into the Logger and fix your numbers, or tap **Delete** to throw out the whole workout.

### ⚙️ Settings (Config)
Customize your ambiance.
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch perfectly between modern Dark Mode and an incredibly clean Light Mode with a simple tap.
- View the app version and general information.
